"I thought I knew SQL... until my interviewer asked me these!"

SQL interviews can be tricky! Here are some thought-provoking questions that tested my knowledge:

1️⃣ How do you compare two tables and find records that exist in one but not the other?
 2️⃣ How can you remove leading and trailing spaces from a column, and why does it matter in joins?
 3️⃣ What’s the difference between INNER JOIN and CROSS JOIN?
 4️⃣ How do you find the first and last record per group using SQL?
 5️⃣ How can you calculate the percentage contribution of each row to a total?
 6️⃣ How do you handle NULL values in aggregations like SUM and AVG?
 7️⃣ How can you split a comma-separated string into multiple rows?
 8️⃣ What’s the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
 9️⃣ How do you find gaps in a sequence of numbers (like missing order IDs)?
 🔟 How do you fetch records from a table based on a dynamic date range (last 7, 30, 90 days)?
 1️⃣1️⃣ How do you identify duplicate rows based on multiple columns?
 1️⃣2️⃣ How can you swap values between two columns without using a temporary table?
 1️⃣3️⃣ How do you find the top-performing category by total sales?
 1️⃣4️⃣ What’s the difference between a subquery and a CTE, and when would you prefer one?
 1️⃣5️⃣ How do you convert rows into columns without using PIVOT?
 1️⃣6️⃣ How can you identify customers with consecutive-day activity?
 1️⃣7️⃣ How do you find records updated in the last X minutes or hours?
 1️⃣8️⃣ What’s the difference between RANK() and NTILE()?
 1️⃣9️⃣ How do you detect sudden spikes or drops in metrics using SQL?
 2️⃣0️⃣ How do you rewrite a correlated subquery to improve performance?

SQL is powerful, but the right questions make you think beyond the basics. Which of these do you find the trickiest? Let’s discuss!
